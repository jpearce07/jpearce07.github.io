          Midnight Oil are more than just a rock ‘n’ roll band. From the northern beaches of Sydney to the streets of Manhattan, they have stopped traffic, inflamed passions, inspired fans, challenged the concepts of “business as usual” and broken new ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          On February 17, 2017 (Australian time) the band held a press conference on Sydney Harbour at which they announced that they would be touring the world from April through November of this year. The tour will be accompanied by the release of three new box sets; one will contain all their existing LP’s and EP’s, another will contain all their existing CD’s and videos plus there will be a new 4 CD/8DVD treasure trove of previously unreleased and rare material called “The Overflow Tank”.

As the tour name implies, “The Great Circle” will begin with an April pub gig in Sydney and then loop around Brazil, North America, Europe and New Zealand before climaxing with a lap of Australia. These circles of both the globe and their homeland will close with one more Sydney show on Remembrance Day.

Of course “The Great Circle” will see the band drawing attention to issues affecting the planet, including collaborating with Greenpeace on crucial issues like dangerous climate change.

The tour name also has a further meaning. Sailors and airmen use “the great circle” to navigate across oceans because the planet’s curvature means the shortest distance between two points is not usually a straight line. It’s appropriate for this band who have always been deeply engaged with the world around them but whose career path has never been obvious or linear.

Midnight Oil is still more than just a rock ’n’ roll band and in 2017 they will bring things back to where they all began. The circle remains unbroken.
